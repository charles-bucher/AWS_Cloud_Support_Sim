🚀 Why This Project Exists

This repository is a hands-on AWS Cloud Support lab designed to simulate real-world troubleshooting scenarios you would encounter as a Cloud Support Engineer, Technical Support Engineer, or CloudOps specialist.

Instead of just following tutorials, I built and broke AWS environments intentionally to practice diagnosing issues, applying fixes, and documenting solutions—mimicking actual cloud support work.

Purpose:

Showcase practical cloud support skills to hiring managers.

Provide reproducible troubleshooting scenarios for hands-on learning.

Build a professional portfolio to land remote, felon-friendly cloud support roles.

🎯 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained real-world, job-ready cloud skills:

AWS Services: EC2, VPC, Security Groups, S3, Lambda, GuardDuty, IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch
Networking & Security: VPC design, routing issues, subnet configs, NACLs, least-privilege IAM policies
Automation: Python + Boto3 for monitoring, detection, and remediation scripts
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform & CloudFormation deployments
DevOps Practices: Git workflows, version control, systematic troubleshooting, documentation
Problem-Solving: Root-cause analysis, security misconfigurations, connectivity failures

🏗️ Project Overview

Hands-on troubleshooting lab simulating eight realistic scenarios:

#	Scenario	What You Learn
1	VPC Network Setup	CIDR blocks, Internet Gateway, connectivity troubleshooting
2	Subnets & Route Tables	Public/private subnets, routing issues, network validation
3	Security Groups & NACLs	Firewall rules, connectivity, least-privilege enforcement
4	Git Version Control Workflow	Branching, merging, collaboration for infrastructure changes
5	Python/Boto3 GuardDuty Automation	Security event detection, remediation, CloudWatch integration
6	S3 Bucket Management	Access policies, troubleshooting permissions and encryption
7	IAM Roles & Policies	Role creation, permission issues, policy troubleshooting
8	CloudWatch Monitoring	Metrics, alarms, dashboards, and AWS service health checks

Each scenario is documented with step-by-step screenshots and diagrams so you can see troubleshooting in action, not just read about it.
