⚡ Cloud Support Simulation Portfolio








👋 Hi! I’m Charles Bucher, a self-taught Cloud Support & NOC Engineer.
This portfolio simulates real-world Cloud Support workflows, showing step-by-step troubleshooting across EC2, Lambda, S3, IAM, and more. Perfect for entry-level cloud support, NOC, or technical support roles.

🚀 What You’ll See in Action

EC2 Troubleshooting – Deploy instances via CloudFormation, debug Security Groups, test SSH connectivity.

Lambda Error Handling – Diagnose errors, check logs, fix IAM/code issues, redeploy.

S3 & IAM Access Control – Identify IAM misconfigurations, simulate access failures, fix permissions.

Portfolio-Ready Visuals – Inline screenshots to showcase scenarios clearly.

Skills Gained – Terraform, CloudFormation, EC2, Lambda, S3, IAM, Python scripting, monitoring, CI/CD basics, operational troubleshooting.
