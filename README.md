Cloud Support Simulation Portfolio ⚡

👋 Hi, I'm Charles Bucher — a self-taught Cloud Support & NOC Engineer.

This portfolio simulates real-world Cloud Support workflows, demonstrating troubleshooting scenarios across EC2, Lambda, S3, IAM, and more. Designed for entry-level cloud support and NOC roles, it shows how incidents are detected, analyzed, and resolved.

🚀 What You’ll See in Action

EC2 troubleshooting: Deploy instances via CloudFormation, validate connectivity, and debug security group issues.

Lambda error handling: Diagnose errors, analyze logs, and fix IAM or code issues.

S3 & IAM access control: Troubleshoot permissions and simulate access failures.

Portfolio-ready visuals: Inline screenshots for immediate clarity.

Skills gained: CloudFormation, EC2, Lambda, S3, IAM, Python scripting, Terraform, monitoring, CI/CD basics, and operational troubleshooting.
